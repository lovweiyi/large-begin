Immune class in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been shown to possess immunogenic power; however, how preestablished immune landscapes in premalignant and early HCC stages impact the clinical outcomes of HCC patients remains unexplored. We sequenced bulk transcriptomes for 62 malignant tumor samples in a Korean HCC cohort where 38 patients underwent total hepatectomy, along with 15 nontumor and 47 premalignant lesions. Using in-silico deconvolution of expression mixtures, 22 immune cell fractions for each sample were inferred, and validated with immune cell counting by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cell type-specific immune signatures were dynamically shifted from premalignant stages to the late HCC stage. Total hepatectomy patients displayed elevated immune infiltration and prolonged disease-free survival compared to partial hepatectomy patients. However, patients who have the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) during the pretransplantation period displayed a high risk of tumor relapse with suppressed immune responses, and pretreatment was a potential driver of Treg infiltration in the total hepatectomy group. Treg infiltration appeared to be independent of molecular classifications based on transcriptomic data. Our study provides not only comprehensive immune signatures in premalignant HCC lesions and early malignant HCC stage but also the clinical guidance for HCC patients who will undergo liver transplantation.
